01_model_creation : contains jupyter notebook going through the process of creating the model

02_flask_api : contains "app.py" and "test_api.py", you will need to run "app.py" first to run the server 
And you can test it either by "test_api.py" or by navigating to "http://localhost:5000/" which will open a basic html page to test the model.

03_documentation : contains the documentation of the task in 2 formats .pdf and .docx, which is going through the steps I took in order to create the model and what assumption I made.
